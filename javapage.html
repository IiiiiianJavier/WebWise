      <h2>Java Script Introduction</h2>
  <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation<br>
     dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), <br>
     meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. <br>
     Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.<br>
      Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level<br>
      applications. JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by<br>
       Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging<br>
       programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented<br> 
       programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose<br>
       programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run <br> 
       on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any <br> 
       Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.</p>
     
       <h3>Why Java?</h3>
       <p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.<br>
        It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.<br></p>
       <h4>It is used for:</h4>
       <p>•Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
        •Desktop applications<br>
        •Web applications<br>
        •Web servers and application servers<br>
        •Games<br>
        •Database connection<br>
        •And much, much more!</p>
    </span>
    
    <span class="introtxt2">
    <h2>What use Java?</h2>
    <p>•Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
      •It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world<br>
      •It has a large demand in the current job market<br>
      •It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
      •It is open-source and free<br>
      •It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
      •It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br>
      •Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused,<br>
       lowering development costs<br>
      •As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

    <h2>Java Version Release Year</h2>
    <img alt="Java-Released-year" height="500"  src="javahistory.jpg" width="800">
      
      <h2>History of Java</h2>
      <p> The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television,<br>
        but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java<br>
       starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop<br>
       a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet<br>
       programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape. The principles for creating Java <br>
       programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded,<br>
       Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling,<br>
        who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project <br>
        in the early '90s.</p>

      <p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. <br>
        Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
     <p> <strong>1.James Gosling</strong>, <strong>Mike Sheridan</strong>, and <strong>Patrick Naughton</strong> initiated the Java language project in June 1991.<br>
         The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.<br>
         <strong>2.</strong> Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.<br>
         <strong>3.</strong> Firstly, it was called <strong>"Greentalk"</strong> by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.<br>
         <strong>4.</strong> After that, it was called <strong>Oak</strong> and was developed as a part of the Green project.<br>
        </p>
      
     <h2>Why Java was named as "Oak"?</h2>
     <p><strong>5. Why Oak?</strong> Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., <br>
        France, Germany, Romania, etc.<br>
        <strong>6.</strong> In 1995, Oak was renamed as <strong>"Java"</strong> because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.
    </p>

      <h2>Why Java Programming named "Java"?</h2>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name.<br>
         The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something<br>
         that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell,<br>
          and fun to say.<br>
    According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with <strong>"Silk"</strong>. Since Java was<br>
     so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.<br>
     <strong>8.</strong> Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso<br>
    bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office. <br>
    <strong>9.</strong> Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym. <br>
    <strong>10.</strong> Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation)<br>
     and released in 1995.<br>
     <strong>11.</strong> In 1995, Time magazine called <strong>Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.</strong><br>

     <strong>12.</strong> JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. After the first release of Java, there have been many<br>
      additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications,<br>
       enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.

      <h2>Java Script Bacic Exercise</h2>
      <h4>EXERCISE:</h4>
      <p>1. Create a JavaScript file named "script.js".<br>
         2. Link the "script.js" file to the HTML file of WebWise.<br>
         3. In the "script.js" file, implement the following functionalities:<br>
         -Create a function called greetUser that prompts the user for their name and then alerts a personalized greeting.<br>
         - Add an event listener to the "click me" button on the WebWise webpage that triggers the greetUser function when clicked.<br>
        </p>

      <h4>JavaScript Code (script.js):</h4>
      <p>// Function to greet the user with a personalized message<br>
        function greetUser() { <br>
            // Prompt the user for their name<br>
            var userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");<br>
            
            // Check if the user entered a name<br>
            if (userName !== null && userName !== "") {<br>
                // Display a personalized greeting<br>
                alert("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to WebWise!");<br>
            } else { <br>
                // If the user didn't enter a name, display a generic greeting<br>
                alert("Hello! Welcome to WebWise!");<br>
            }<br>
        }<br>
        
        // Add event listener to the "click me" button<br>
        var button = document.getElementById("clickMeButton");<br>
        button.addEventListener("click", greetUser);<br>
        ```

        <h4>Explanation of the code:</h4>
        <p><strong>-GreetUser Function:</strong> This function prompts the user for their name using the prompt method and stores<br>
         the input in the userName variable. It then checks if the user entered a name. If a name is provided,<br>
         it alerts a personalized greeting message using the entered name. If no name is provided, it alerts<br>
          a generic greeting message.<br>
        <strong>-Event Listener:</strong> The addEventListener method is used to add an event listener to the "click me" button<br>
         on the WebWise webpage. When the button is clicked, it triggers the greetUser function, which prompts the<br>
          user for their name and displays a greeting message accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>This exercise introduces learners to basic JavaScript concepts such as functions, user input, conditional statements,<br>
             and event handling, enhancing interactivity on  creating their own website.</p>
