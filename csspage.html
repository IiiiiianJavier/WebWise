      <h2>CSS Introduction</h2>
  <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages <br>
    presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to HTML documents. It describes how a webpage should look. <br>
    It prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, etc. In short, you can make your website look however you want. <br>
    CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the<br>
     browser. HTML uses tags and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.<br>
     CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>
     <h3>Why CSS?</h3>
     <strong>CSS Saves Time</strong>- You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. <br>
      <strong>Search Engines</strong>- CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content. <br>
      <strong>Superior styles to HTML</strong>- CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.<br>
      <strong>Offline Browsing</strong>- CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.

    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>•CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets<br>
      •CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media<br>
      •CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once<br>
      •External stylesheets are stored in CSS files<br>
      </p>
    </span>
    <span class="introtxt3">
    <h2>CSS Version Release Year</h2>
    <img alt="CSS-Released-year" height="350"  src="CSS-Released-year.png" width="800">
    <p> CSS was created HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to allow web designers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their <br>
      websites. Originally, websites were meant to be used by researchers only, so the decoration did not matter.<br>
      However, when websites became widespread, the need to make them look nice grew.</p>
      
      <h2>History of CSS</h2>
      <p>"Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable standard. <br>
        As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the standard.<br>
         This is being done in accordance with W3C rules. CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released <br>
         in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999. CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. <br>
         CSS level 2 adds support for different output media. CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up <br>
         in modules. The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this <br>
         approach is that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) <br>
         to affect all pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this <br>
         separation of concerns, the W3C has deprecated the "font" tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will deprecate<br>
         other tags in a similar vein. CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. CSS is a language to define <br>
         format properties of HTML or XML tags. HTML has reached the end of it's shelf life and is not being developed <br>
         further. XHTML is the new standard instead. XHTML reformulates HTML with XML syntax while at the same time <br>
         getting rid of presentational markup. XHTML only contains content, presentation is the domain of a CSS stylesheet.<br>
         This allows for different stylesheets for different output formats such as print, aural or small devices. <br>
         Search machines on the other hand have an easier job if they are only presented with content markup."</p>
      
     <h2>CSS Variations</h2>
     <p>"CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features <br>
      and typically denoted as CSS 1, CSS 2, and CSS 3. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of <br>
      CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, <br>
      and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.</p>

      <h2>CSS 1</h2>
    <p>The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published in December 1996. <br>
      Among its capabilities are support for</p>
      <p>•Font properties such as typeface and emphasis<br>
        •Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements<br>
        •Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text<br>
        •Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements<br>
        •Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements<br>
        •Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes<br>
        </p>
     
        <h2>CSS 2</h2>
        <p>CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a Recommendation in May 1998.<br>
           A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed <br>
            positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets and <br>
            bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 <br>
            recommendation.</p>
        
        <p>CSS level 2 revision 1 or CSS 2.1 fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly-supported or not fully interoperable<br>
          features and adds already-implemented browser extensions to the specification. In order to comply with the W3C<br>
           Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status <br>
           and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on <br>
           February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005 for further review. It was returned<br>
            to Candidate Recommendation status on 19 July 2007 and was updated twice in 2009. However, since changes and <br>
            clarifications were made to the prose it went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010. Later it went<br>
             into Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011. It was published as a Recommendation on 7 June 2011.</p>

        <h2>CSS 3</h2>
        <p>Instead of defining all features in a single, large specification like CSS 2, CSS 3 is divided into several<br>
           separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capability or extends features defined in CSS 2,<br>
            over preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the <br>
            original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.</p>

            <p>Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and are in different status. <br>
              As of March 2011, there are over 40 CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group. Some modules <br>
              such as Selectors, Namespaces, Color and Media Queries are considered stable and are either in Candidate<br>
               Recommendation or Proposed Recommendation status. Once CSS 2.1 is finalized and published<br> 
               as Recommendation, they are likely to go to Recommendation as well.</p>

        <h2>CSS BASIC EXERCISES</h2>
        <h4>EXERCISE:</h4>
        <p>Objective: Apply Basic styling to an HTML document</p>
  
        <h4>Explanation:</h4>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets ) may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, <br> use Inline CSS in a style attribute.
          By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet.<br>
         We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.<br></p>
          
           <p>To complete this exercise, follow these steps:<br>
  
          <strong>1.</strong> Create an HTML file with a sample structure.<br>
           <strong>2.</strong> Link a CSS file to the HTML document. <br>
           <strong>3.</strong> Apply basic styling such as setting the background color, font size, and text color.<br>
          
          </p>
  
          <h3>HTML CODE:</h3>

          </p>
  
          <h4>HTML CODE EXPLANATION:</h4>
          <ul><li>The HTML document starts with the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> 
          declaration, specifying the document type and version.</li><li>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> 
          element defines the root of the HTML document, with the <code>lang="en"</code> attribute indicating that 
          the language is English.</li><li>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, metadata like character encoding 
          and viewport settings are specified.</li><li>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag includes an external stylesheet 
          named "styles.css" to apply CSS styles to the HTML document.</li><li>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> 
          element sets the title of the webpage displayed in the browser tab.</li><li>Inside the <code>&lt;
          body&gt;</code> element, there's an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading with the text "Hello, CSS!" and a 
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph with the text <br>"This is a sample paragraph."</li></ul>
          
          <h4>CSS CODE EXPLANATION:</h4>
          <ul><li>The CSS code targets the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element and sets its background color to a light gray shade 
          <code>#f0f0f0</code>.</li><li>It also specifies a default font size of <code>16px</code> and a text color of <code>#333</code> 
          (dark gray) for all elements within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</li><li>The CSS rule targeting the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> 
          element changes its text color to a shade of blue <code>#0066cc</code>.</li></ul>
